import ComposableArchitecture

/// A reducer wrapper that enforces mutual exclusion (locking) for actions,
/// based on their `LockAction.lockMode` and the current state's lock level.
///
/// Locking behavior:
/// - `.exclusiveLock`: Acquires a strong lock. If the state is already locked (exclusively or otherwise), the action is skipped.
/// - `.cancellableLock`: Acquires a weaker lock. If the state is already exclusively locked, the action is skipped. Otherwise, the lock is replaced.
/// - `.unlock`: Releases the current lock, allowing new actions to proceed.
/// - `.none`: No locking behavior. The action proceeds as usual.
///
/// This mechanism helps prevent overlapping side effects such as duplicate API calls,
/// unintended reentrancy, or excessive button tapping.
